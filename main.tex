\noindent \textcolor{red}{Project description including: Aims, significance, and expected outcome of the project.}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Brief problem description and project introduction.
  \item Aims and objectives of the research project (keep vague).
  \item Research significance and applications, you can talk about PQC, language verification, etc.
  \item Expected results... we expect to reimplement important theorems surrounding the word problem for groups...

\section{Background}\label{sec:background}
[maximum 200 words] \\

\begin{itemize}
    \item Summary of relevant literature and theoretical framework
    \item Identification of gaps or areas for further research
    \item Explanation of how the proposed research fills those gaps or contributes to the existing knowledge

\paragraph{Preliminaries.} A group $G$ is said to be finitely generated if it's generating set is finite.

\paragraph{The Word Problem for Groups.} Given a group $G$ and a generating set $X$ for $G$, the word problem for $G$ and $X$ denoted $\WP(G,X)$, asks to decide whether,

\begin{theorem}[{\cite[Theorem~3.4.1]{HoltEtAl2017}}]\label{thm:finite-groups-dfa-wp}
  Given a finitely generated group $G$ with generating set $X$, $\WP(G,X)$ is regular if and only if $G$ is finite.
\end{theorem}

\paragraph{Formal Verification in Lean} Many recent projects have investigated formalising mathematical theories in lean.
